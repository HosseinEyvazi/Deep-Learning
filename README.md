- **Purpose:** Designed for processing grid-like data such as images.
- **Applications:** Image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
- **Features:** Spatial feature extraction using convolutional layers.

### 2. **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)**
- **Purpose:** General-purpose networks for structured data and simple tasks.
- **Applications:** Regression, classification, and tabular data analysis.
- **Features:** Fully connected layers with flexible architectures.

### 3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
- **Purpose:** Suitable for sequential data processing.
- **Applications:** Time-series forecasting, text generation, and language modeling.
- **Features:** Temporal memory using hidden states across sequences.

### 4. **Transformers**
- **Purpose:** State-of-the-art models for sequence-to-sequence tasks.
- **Applications:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), text generation, and machine translation.
- **Features:** Attention mechanisms for parallelized and context-aware learning.
